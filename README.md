🧩 Overview

Backend development is all about logic, architecture, and scalability.
You’ll learn how to:

Build APIs and microservices

Design databases and data models

Implement authentication and security

Optimize performance and scalability

Deploy and monitor applications in production

⚙️ Technologies

The roadmap uses a modern, flexible tech stack:

Languages: JavaScript (Node.js), Python, Go, Java

Frameworks: Express.js, Django / FastAPI, Spring Boot

Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis

APIs: REST, GraphQL, gRPC

Authentication: JWT, OAuth2

DevOps Tools: Docker, CI/CD, Nginx, AWS / GCP / Azure

Testing: Jest, Pytest, Postman

Version Control: Git, GitHub

🧱 Learning Stages

Topics:

Internet, HTTP, and client-server model

REST APIs basics

Node.js & Express.js basics

CRUD operations

Environment variables

Git & GitHub

Mini Projects:

🌐 Simple HTTP Server — Create a basic Node.js server that returns JSON.

📚 Book Management API — CRUD operations using Express and a JSON file.

🟡 Stage 2 — Intermediate

Goal: Learn databases, authentication, and middleware logic.

Topics:

SQL & NoSQL databases

ORM (Sequelize, Mongoose)

Authentication (JWT, sessions)

Error handling and logging

File uploads

Environment management

Projects:

👤 User Authentication System — Register/login using JWT.

🔵 Stage 3 — Advanced

Goal: Develop scalable, secure, and maintainable systems.

Topics:

Caching with Redis

Rate limiting and security headers

Testing (unit & integration)

CI/CD pipelines

Docker & containerization

API documentation (Swagger / Postman)

Projects:

📰 Blog Platform API — Token-based auth, comments, likes, and roles.

🧾 Payment Service — Stripe integration and webhooks.

🧠 Microservices Architecture — Split services using Docker Compose.

🔴 Stage 4 — Expert

Goal: Design enterprise-grade, distributed backend systems.

Topics:

Event-driven architecture (Kafka / RabbitMQ)

gRPC & GraphQL APIs

Horizontal scaling & load balancing

Monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana)

Cloud deployment (AWS ECS, Lambda, Kubernetes)

System design principles
